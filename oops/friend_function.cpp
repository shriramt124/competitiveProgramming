/*
Characteristics of friend function:

A friend function can be declared in the private or public section of the class.
It can be called a normal function without using the object.
A friend function is not in the scope of the class, of which it is a friend.
A friend function is not invoked using the class object as it is not in the classâ€™s scope.
A friend function cannot access the private and protected data members of the class directly. It needs to make use of a class object and then access the members using the dot operator.
A friend function can be a global function or a member of another class.
