/* 
Your current solution for the Codeforces problem 701C is giving a **TLE (Time Limit Exceeded)** because of the following reason:

### Inefficient Sliding Window
In your implementation, the `solv()` function creates a substring for each window `str.substr(start, end)` and then generates a temporary set `temp(res.begin(), res.end())` for every iteration of `i` and `j`. This results in **O(nÂ²)** complexity due to the substring creation and set operations, which is too slow for `n = 100,000`.

### How to Improve:
You should avoid repeatedly creating substrings and sets. Instead, use a **sliding window** approach combined with a **frequency map** (or array) to track the occurrences of each character in the window.

### Optimized Approach:
1. **Use a Frequency Map**:  
   Maintain a frequency count of each character within the current window `[i, j]`.
   
2. **Sliding Window Logic**:  
   Expand the window by moving `j` to the right, and shrink the window by moving `i` to the right, ensuring that all unique characters are in the current window.

3. **Optimal Time Complexity**:  
   Using a frequency map allows the solution to work in **O(n)** time because you only traverse the string once, updating the frequency count in constant time.

 

### Explanation:
- **Set**: We first create a set of all unique characters in the string, so we know how many unique characters we need in the window.
- **Sliding Window**: 
   - `i` is the left pointer, and `j` is the right pointer.
   - As we expand the window by moving `j`, we increase the count of characters in the frequency map.
   - Once we have all the unique characters in the window (i.e., `count == total_unique`), we try to shrink the window by moving `i` to minimize the window size while maintaining all unique characters.
   - The moment a unique character is removed (frequency becomes 0), we stop shrinking and continue expanding.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: Both `i` and `j` traverse the string once, and each update to the frequency map takes constant time. Hence, the overall complexity is linear, which is efficient for `n = 100,000`.
