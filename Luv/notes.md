## calculations happens based on higher data type 

### descreasing order of data types 

1.Double 
2.float
3.long long int
4.long int
5.int 
6.characters

`cout<<'c'<<endl` -> output : 99(asci code of character c )
`cout<<'c'+1<<endl`; --> output : 100 because  ascii value of 'c' is 99 and we are adding one to it so the  output


## Ranges
*  char : -128 to +127
* int : -10^9 to 10^9
* long int : -10^12 to 10^12
* long long int : -10^18 to 10^18
* float : -10^38 to 10^38 (approximately)
* double: -10^308 to 10^308 (approximately)

# 
why can't we use `double ` insetead of long int or long long int 

* we avoid using double and float because they can store  a large number but the precision is not that much, so it will lose accuracy while storing big numbers that is why we avoid using double or float
